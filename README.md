## TODO

Think of an efficient way of handling files and folders open and closed. Think of a good datastructure that can do the job. There can be multiple files in a folder. Clicking the appropriate file and folder should push or pop something.

## Solution

It has to be a tree data structure. From root to a node path. Recompute path at every click.
